The project, implemented in SAS, performs various steps such as importing data from Excel sheets, cleaning, formatting, stacking and sorting data, merging tables, converting units to the metric system, creating new variables, and visualizing results.

Key Features:

1. Data Import: Importing data from Excel sheets containing historical records, statistics, and student information.
2. Data Integration: Stacking and sorting data from historical and statistical records.
3. Data Merging: Combining information from different tables using both data step and PROC SQL.
4. Unit Conversion: Converting weight and height into metric system units for standardized analysis.
5. Add new columns: BMI Calculation: Deriving Body Mass Index (BMI) and categorizing individuals into different health status groups.
6. Visualization: Generating a pie chart to visualize the distribution of health statuses.
7. Frequency Analysis: Creating frequency distribution tables and transposing them for gender and health status.
